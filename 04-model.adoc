== Model

This model is composed of Web Ontology Language (OWL) <<OWL>> Classes and Properties. While some properties may be restricted in their use to various classes, the Classes and Properties are actually defined individually and both are "first class model citizens", with global identity, that can be used in isolation and together. This is in contrast to Unified Modelling Language (UML) _Class Diagrams_ which treat Properties as sub-parts of particular classes.

This model defines some Classes and Properties and also requires certain existing Cs & Ps for reuse. All Cs & Ps in this model, both defined and reused, are listed here with an indication of where the element is defined given in the _Is Defined By_ field.


[[Classes]]
=== Classes

The Classes within this model form a single Class Hierarchy with <<SpatialObject>> as the root class. The top-level classes of <<SpatialObject>>, <<Feature>>, <<FeatureCollection>> and <<Geometry>> are all inherited from <<GEO>> and used here unchanged.
